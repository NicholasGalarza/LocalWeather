# fcc-local-weather
This is a small program that will make an HTTP Get request to the OpenWeather API. 
It will utilize the Dark Sky API to gather weather information and I use ajax to asynchronusly load different weather options include: 

* Current Weather Conditions in your area & minute by minute forecasts. 
* Hour-by-hour forecast for the day. 
* And a seven day forcast for the week.
